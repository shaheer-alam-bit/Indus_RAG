Did things change down here,\nin a world of nearly perpetual dark, a population only concerned with the\nnext job, the next sleep, the next meal?\nIronic, Anakin thought to himself. Because while he wondered about the\nculture and safety of the local residents, Padmé focused entirely on the\nimmediate: the franikhad in her hands, metallic foil wrapper preserving its\nheat. “This is really, really, really good,” she said, taking large bites without\nthe decorum usually found in governmental banquet halls.\n-------\nPage Unknown: deeper.

It sounds like she and a few other\nsenators agree with the Jedi using the opportunity to speak to Cato\nNeimoidia. I haven’t seen her since Geonosis, but she looks no worse for\nwear.”\nAnakin stood up again, a careful move that avoided any table collisions\nthis time. Then he knelt back to the access panel of the holoprojector, his\nface completely hidden. “If you run into her again, tell her I say hello. One\nsecond,” he said, tinkering with the configuration. “Can’t let anyone know I\nwas watching podracing.” Now Obi-Wan sat and waited, giving Anakin the\nspace to restore the holoprojector settings but also himself the space to\nprocess what he’d witnessed, not visibly but through the Force.\nBecause that same surge came at the mention of Padmé, like a button\n-------\nPage Unknown: as stools and toward the path leading out of Uhmandasee Market.\n“Wait, we’re not done with the sundae,” Anakin said, glancing back at\nthe almost-but-not-quite-finished dessert.\n“I think we can let it go. You’ll see.” Padmé pulled with intensity and\npicked up her pace. They wove their way through the mix of underworld\nlocals and curious surface travelers until breaking past the perimeter of the\nmarket where their speeder sat parked. She opened the storage compartment\nand pulled out the bag she’d packed right when they picked up the rental\nvehicle from the dealer several levels below the planet’s surface. She held it\nup to show him, but he failed to catch anything special about it.\nIt appeared to be just what it was.\n“It’s a bag. Am I missing something?”\n“It is a bag. But sometimes what’s important is what’s inside.” Padmé\nkept her eyes locked with his, a mischievous smile on her face, as she\ntugged on the bag’s drawstrings, opening it enough to pull out…\nFolded blankets?\n-------\nPage Unknown: sight of her walking into Watto’s shop that he blurted out the first thing that\ncame to mind. “I have something for you.”\n“A gift? Ani, you never need to worry about those things.”\n“It’s not much. You know, the Jedi and our rules about possession. I can’t\ngive you things,” he said, opening the pouch on his belt. His fingers\nwrapped around a disk-shaped gold pendant, its necklace chain dangling as\nhe pressed it into her hand. “But I can give you a piece of me.”\nPadmé held it up, the harsh light from the vendor’s window enough to\nput the object in full view. “Is this…?”\n“My Padawan braid.” She traced the braid, now coiled into a spiral and\nencased in carbonite as it sat within the pendant’s simple design. “To new\nbeginnings.”\nEven in the dim light, Anakin could see the flush come to Padmé’s\ncheeks, and though she’d been known to sway entire systems through the\npower of words, her mouth remained open yet silent. But she didn’t need to\nsay anything.\n-------\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":146},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Use Qwen2.5 3B with the correct message format\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\n\n# Generate output using the model\noutput = generator(messages)\n\n# Print formatted response\nprint(textwrap.fill(output[0][\"generated_text\"], width=80))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-16T17:40:07.893027Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-16T17:40:07.893397Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-16T17:42:03.232300Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-16T17:40:07.893354Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-16T17:42:03.231464Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"During the night at the Uhmandasee Market, Anakin Skywalker gifts Padmé Amidala\na piece of his Padawan braid encased in carbonite and set within a simple\npendant.
