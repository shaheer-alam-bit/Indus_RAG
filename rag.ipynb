She turned to him,\ninquisitively. “Now I’m going to try the franikhad.”\n—\nIt was close to Tatooine cooking—close enough that Anakin considered\nways he could discreetly get credits, find a speeder, and enjoy it from time\n-------\nPage Unknown: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away….\nThe CLONE WARS have erupted. Caught off guard by the quickly\nexpanding conflict, the overwhelmed Jedi Order has rushed the\nadvancement of Padawans to better integrate into the Grand Army of the\nRepublic and assist the war effort.\nNewly promoted Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker is increasingly torn\nbetween his growing duties to the Republic and his secret marriage to\nSenator Padmé Amidala of Naboo. With his Knighting, his mentor Obi-\nWan Kenobi has been elevated to the Jedi Council under the rank of Jedi\nMaster.\nAs dark forces push the Jedi further toward their transformation from\nguardians to soldiers, Anakin and Obi-Wan find themselves on equal\nfooting yet opposing paths, each pondering the meaning of peace and\njustice during a time of war…\nCHAPTER 1\nRUUG QUARNOM\nCato Neimoidia was a world of mist.\nHigh above that mist, cliffs and branches poked through, carved at all\nangles into immense mountainous spires. The thick stone of the planet’s\n-------\nPage Unknown: in a world of nearly perpetual dark, a population only concerned with the\nnext job, the next sleep, the next meal?\nIronic, Anakin thought to himself. Because while he wondered about the\nculture and safety of the local residents, Padmé focused entirely on the\nimmediate: the franikhad in her hands, metallic foil wrapper preserving its\nheat. “This is really, really, really good,” she said, taking large bites without\nthe decorum usually found in governmental banquet halls.\nMaybe it was because none of the handmaidens lingered around to see it.\n“And,” she added, finishing the franikhad in a gulp, “I don’t want to know\nwhat’s in it.” She dabbed the napkin against her lips. “You haven’t touched\nyours yet. Afraid it’s not going to be close to the real thing?”\n“The real thing” being a franikhad, a dish commonly found on desert\nplanets. The term delicacy went a little too far; variations existed based on\nlocal meats and culture, but nearly every desert planet that Anakin knew of\n-------\nPage Unknown: as stools and toward the path leading out of Uhmandasee Market.\n“Wait, we’re not done with the sundae,” Anakin said, glancing back at\nthe almost-but-not-quite-finished dessert.\n“I think we can let it go. You’ll see.” Padmé pulled with intensity and\npicked up her pace. They wove their way through the mix of underworld\nlocals and curious surface travelers until breaking past the perimeter of the\nmarket where their speeder sat parked. She opened the storage compartment\nand pulled out the bag she’d packed right when they picked up the rental\nvehicle from the dealer several levels below the planet’s surface. She held it\nup to show him, but he failed to catch anything special about it.\nIt appeared to be just what it was.\n“It’s a bag. Am I missing something?”\n“It is a bag. But sometimes what’s important is what’s inside.” Padmé\nkept her eyes locked with his, a mischievous smile on her face, as she\ntugged on the bag’s drawstrings, opening it enough to pull out…\nFolded blankets?\n-------\nPage Unknown: rotating and zooming into the sky, its distinctive chug-chug-chug sound\ngradually disappearing and blending into the never-ending din of Coruscant.\nAnakin held up his comlink and considered pressing the top button to open\nthe channel, a way to both needle Obi-Wan and verify that it worked. But he\nput it away, having tested it last night with Padmé in the security of her\napartment.\nIn fact, last night was all about the mission. It wasn’t supposed to be—\nthey’d planned on a quiet night in, simply enjoying the fact that they were\nin the same place at the same time for another night. But Padmé had been in\nfull senatorial mode, and despite Anakin’s best attempts to distract her with\nphysical temptations, the bulk of the evening involved understanding the\nnuances with Neimoidians: as a culture, with the local Cato Neimoidian\ngovernment, and with the Trade Federation as a larger entity.\nPadmé’s inability to turn it off was something that had already made their\n-------\nPage Unknown: “You got it, boss. Cream and sugar in yours, hon?”\n“Oh, no,” Obi-Wan said. “I prefer my caf straight black.”\nCHAPTER 6\nANAKIN SKYWALKER\nThe view above looked like stars, though Anakin knew better.\nThey both did, really, the pinpricks of light being blinking status beacons\nor glowing signage from higher levels. That was life in Coruscant’s\nunderbelly among its endless rows of massive structures. But it was\nromantic for anyone willing to pretend the lights were stars and the\nindustrial fumes puffing from nearby stacks and vents were fog.\nThe artificial night sky made the underworld feel like a completely\ndifferent place—not just a location in the Republic, but a portal to another\ndimension. In Uhmandasee Market, a new smell came every few meters,\nthough Padmé led Anakin to one very specific rusty stall. They sat on a\nstack of rusty crates, something that may have even been in that very\nlocation since the days of the High Republic. Did things change down here,\n-------\nPage Unknown: sight of her walking into Watto’s shop that he blurted out the first thing that\ncame to mind. “I have something for you.”\n“A gift? Ani, you never need to worry about those things.”\n“It’s not much. You know, the Jedi and our rules about possession. I can’t\ngive you things,” he said, opening the pouch on his belt. His fingers\nwrapped around a disk-shaped gold pendant, its necklace chain dangling as\nhe pressed it into her hand. “But I can give you a piece of me.”\nPadmé held it up, the harsh light from the vendor’s window enough to\nput the object in full view. “Is this…?”\n“My Padawan braid.” She traced the braid, now coiled into a spiral and\nencased in carbonite as it sat within the pendant’s simple design. “To new\nbeginnings.”\nEven in the dim light, Anakin could see the flush come to Padmé’s\ncheeks, and though she’d been known to sway entire systems through the\npower of words, her mouth remained open yet silent. But she didn’t need to\nsay anything.\n-------\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":94},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Use Qwen2.5 3B with the correct message format\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\n\n# Generate output using the model\noutput = generator(messages)\n\n# Print formatted response\nprint(textwrap.fill(output[0][\"generated_text\"], width=80))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-16T16:20:37.087796Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-16T16:20:37.088083Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-16T16:23:38.561850Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-16T16:20:37.088061Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-16T16:23:38.560926Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"During the night at the Uhmandasee Market, Anakin Skywalker gifts Padmé Amidala\na piece of his Padawan braid encased in carbonite and set in a simple pendant.\nThis gift symbolizes \"new beginnings\" between them.
